# Sample full stack MEVN app

Pre-reqs:
- Set up mongo-db (see instructions in server/README.md)
- Install [node.js and npm](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-node-js-on-ubuntu-20-04)

## Running app
- Open two terminals and go to the directory this README is in.
- In the 1st terminal enter the following commands:
```
cd server
node server.js
```
- In the 2nd terminal enter the following commands:
```
cd frontend
npm run serve
```
- Open the frontend page in your browser, for me it is `http://localhost:8081`
